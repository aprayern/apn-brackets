            <h1>Welcome to <span>A Prayer Notebook</span></h1>

            <h2>The Prayer Summary Above as Text reads: </h2>

            <p> 



#0 Our Father In Heaven</strong><br />Is an introduction to the 



prayer. <br />We give (in this section)<br />links to some material to 



accompany your <br />use of a copy of " A Prayer Notebook." <br />The 



content of the introductory phrase<br />is 3 simple ideas:<br />(1) 



Prayer is *personal (OUR)<br />(2) Prayer is *family (FATHER)<br /> 



(3) Prayer is *humble (IN HEAVEN) -- <br />"I'm praying from Earth."</p>

			<p> 



&nbsp;#1 Hallowed Be Your Name</strong><br />Hallowing God's Name in prayer 



is <br />the ABSOLUTE ESSENCE OF <br />PRAYING WITH POWER. <br />The 



CHARACTER AND DEEDS of the God <br />who asks of us such regular 



prayer<br />about such personal things <br />MAKES EACH PETITION 



REALIZABLE!<br />ADORATION is first <i>acknowledging</i><br /> and 



then <i>thanking</i> God for<br /> (1) WHO HE IS. His IDENTITY.<br /> 



AND for (2) WHAT HE DOES. His ACTIVITY.



</p>

			<p> 



			#2 Your Kingdom Come</strong><br />Praying the Kingdom of God 



comes<br />involves 2 BASIC CONCEPTS.<br /> [1] Understanding 



'DISPENSATIONAL'  <br />time periods revealed in scripture. --<br 



/>RIGHTLY DIVIDING THE WORD!--2 Timothy 2:15 <br />And [2] PREPARING 



for God's kingdom. <br />It is at least FIVE fold.<br />(1) SALVATION, 



(2) EVANGELIZATION, <br />(3) EDUCATION, (4) OCCUPATION, <br /> and 



(5) EXPECTATION.</p>

			<p> 



&nbsp;#3 Your Will Be Done<br />On Earth As It Is in Heaven</strong><br 



/>Heb 12.9 -"Shall we not much more readily be <br />in 



subjection to the Father of spirits and live?"<br />Submission to God 



is the most difficult<br />(on a human dimension) to actually execute. 



<br />Many concepts entail this principle.<br />Praying submission 



prayers <br />BECOMES (by eventual choices) submission <br />itself. 



Other scriptures guide in tandem. <br />These are prayers God WILL 



answer!



</p>

			<p> 



			#4 Give Us This Day Our <br />Daily Bread</strong><br />"The MOST 



PRAYERS TODAY petition."<br /><i>The petition principle marks a 



distinct<br />change in the prayer view: </i><br />from VERTICLE -- 



God-ward (PRINCIPLES: ADORATION, ANTICIPATION, AND SUBMISSION) praying 



<br />to HORIZONTAL -- Man-focused (PRINCIPLES: PETITION, CONFESSION, 



<br />AND RESOLUTION) praying. This prayer is <br />for our true human 



and earthly NEEDS:<br />(1)Physical,(2)mental,(3)emotional,(4)social,



(5)financial.</p>

			<p> 



&nbsp;#5 And Forgive Us Our Debts <br /> As We Forgive Our 



Debtors</strong><br />After salvation the soul begins a 



relationship<br />with the Spirit of God referred to in scripture as a 



"walk."<br />It is affected by deeds and thoughts.<br />Sin breaks 



fellowship with God and causes <br />the Spirit of God to bring us 



into conviction<br />"(6 aspects of) CONFESSION " of sins committed 



<br />after salvation of the soul restores that fellowship.



</p>

			<p> 



			#6 And Lead Us Not <br />Into Temptation --<br />But Deliver Us From 



Evil</strong>. <br>There are 2 main parts about the principle 



<br />we're calling Resolution: Avoiding temptation,<br />and then 



suiting up in some Armor <br />GOD Himself has given. God does His 



part, <br />and we must do our part! <br />Prayer about Temptation is 



biblical. <br />Prayer will help me resist.



</p>

			<p> 



			#7 For Yours Is the Kingdom,<br />the Power, and the Glory Forever. 



Amen.</strong><br /><br />To close His model prayer, a return to 



ADORATION.<br />Bringing glory to God is loving others.<br />Loving 



others is really praying for them <br />as one prays for self. 



Ephesians 6:18a: Praying always <br />with all prayer and supplication 



in the Spirit. <br />Glorifying God includes scripture memory. <br 



/>It means singing also.</p>

			<p> 



			#8. Application. To this point, prayer has been personal from the 

			offerer FOR the offerer. Hereafter it becomes outward with detail 

			yet intimacy for others. Because it is detail, God is given the 

			power to ANSWER WITH DETAIL, thus in supernatural ways. </p>







			<p><b><font size="2">&quot;A Prayer Notebook&quot; is my gift from God now being 

			offered to you. <br>You may receive it as a gift, just as it was given to me 

			from the Lord. </font>
